# EggsCatcherGame
A mini game which was built using Python and tkinter GUI library. The purpose of the game is to catch as many eggs as possible using a box which is controlled with keyboard (keys can be changes in the settings menu). It was created as a coursework assignment for the introductory course of Python programming, so OOP has not been much used here.
